## Usage of test scripts

The test scripts test the cuts produced on the graphs placed in the order specified in config.py. The default path is ../affinity/walshaw/. To run the test scripts execute `python3 -B test.py ordering_alg`. ordering_alg is an element of {affinity, plm, alg_dist, fa2, accumulated} and describes the ordering algorithm used.
